        problem: Model predictive control problem to solve.
        solver: Quadratic programming solver to use, to choose in
            :data:`qpsolvers.available_solvers`. Both "quadprog" and "osqp"
            tend to perform well on model predictive control problems. See for
            instance `this benchmark
            <https://github.com/qpsolvers/qpsolvers#benchmark>`__.
        sparse: Whether to use sparse or dense matrices in the output quadratic
            program. Enable it if the QP solver is sparse (e.g. OSQP).
        kwargs: Keyword arguments forwarded to the QP solver via the
            `solve_qp`_ function.

    Returns:
        Solution to the problem, if found.
